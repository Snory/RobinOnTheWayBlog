> "I did not get a chance" – a sentence from "Million Dollar Baby" that sparked a profound emotion within me. It prompted a realization that every day, I'm presented with an opportunity to engage in something I genuinely desire. It would truly be a regrettable circumstance to pass away without discovering whether my passion holds true, or if I possess the capability to transform it into reality.

This is going to be the first series I'll be writing on a regular basis. Each post will correspond to a specific month, capturing what I've been focusing on and more. Recognizing the importance of having a routine to achieve my goals, I'll be tracking the time spent on various topics. Additionally, I'll be planning and preparing blog content in advance, outlining my monthly focus to stay on track.

### Focus of the month

August is going to revolve around the theme of art. During this month, I plan to delve into various aspects of art, including learning Blender, honing my drawing skills, and exploring shaders. Additionally, I will dedicate some time to GatsbyJS to improve my blogging capabilities. These are the four skills I would like to explore, which go hand in hand with the idea that I am able to dedicate at least 4 hours a day to learning. You know, considering 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work (which can feel like quite a waste, right :)), and 8 hours of free time, of which I intend to spend half with my fiancée. We'll see if this plan is achievable.

### Reflection
