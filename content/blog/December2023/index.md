### Focus of the month

December is going to be weird. I have half of the month vacation therefore I think I do not plan to force myself to spend some time by adhere to some rules, but at the same time I would like to work on my identity in order to achieve the result I desire - 3 hours of working on myself a day.

There is a list of topics I would like to more or less cover during the month:

* ASP.Net deep dive
* Domain driven development - how to start
* Blender - prepare few empty bodies for game jams, write down the tutorial for it
* Unity - camera workflow

And there are topics I am going to be interested in, but I am not going to count them towards the 3 hour goal:

* Financial independence - read a book about it
* Focus - working on my focus, read a books about it (Hyper focus, Deep work)
* Train body - I have to start moving somehow

### Reflection

As I predicted, I was not able to force myself to spend some time learning during my vacation. Not only was I sick, but I also ended up experiencing a little 'collapse' caused by stress, so I had to chill down a bit. I spent a total of 18 hours learning in December, which is the lowest amount spent on learning last year.

Most of the time (almost ten hours) went into Domain-Driven Development as I planned. The rest was distributed among Blender, DevOps (I was learning about K8s, Argo), Asp.Net, and Unity.

I honestly have nothing more to say about December, so I am going to cut it short this time.
