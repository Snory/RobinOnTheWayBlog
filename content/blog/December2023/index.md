### Focus of the month

December is going to be weird. I have half of the month vacation therefore I think I do not plan to force myself to spend some time by adhere to some rules, but at the same time I would like to work on my identity in order to achieve the result I desire - 3 hours of working on myself a day.

There is a list of topics I would like to more or less cover during the month:

* ASP.Net deep dive
* Domain driven development - how to start
* Blender - prepare few empty bodies for game jams, write down the tutorial for it
* Unity - camera workflo

And there are topics I am going to be interested in, but I am not going to count them towards the 3 hour goal:

* Financial independence - read a book about it
* Focus - working on my focus, read a books about it (Hyper focus, Deep work)
* Train body - I have to start moving somehow
