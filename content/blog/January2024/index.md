### Focus of the month

January, a special month which encourages me to give myself some New Year's resolutions. I was thinking about not doing so because I have a problem sticking to the 'focus of the month,' but that led me to some resolutions, so here they are:

* Try to set the 'focus of the month' in a way that I am going to be able to stick with it.
* I have to relax more due to my health. But I was thinking instead of relaxing to be actively bored. Like sitting and just staring to the wall and let the thoughts flow.

Last year I was trying to hit the goal of learning 3 hours per day, but I was nowhere near. It is just too much time. This was all because I wanted to learn a lot of stuff, some work-related, some for my game development hobby. Both consist of small parts that I have to learn in order to be good at them. So I am going to start with simple goal. One hour of learning per day.

For january, february and march it is going to be quite simple - I signed myself to c# course at work and for each month there are task to be done, so I am going to start with that.

I also promised my friend I am going to learn japanese with him, so this is somehthing I can skip either.

Well, this is it, simple as that.
