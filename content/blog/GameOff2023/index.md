### Game concept

I am thinking about a game where a camera focuses on the entire arena, offering a full view of the action as multiple objects (not necessarily balls) bounce and fly around. The player's mission is to avoid these objects while being able to redirect their paths.

At a certain distance from the player, these objects will slow down (**scale down the speed**), allowing for precision redirection. The more accurate and skillful the player's redirections, the less the objects will slow down. To further intensify the experience, as the game progresses, the arena becomes increasingly crowded with more and faster-moving objects. 

This game is already quite good as it is; the goal is to survive as long as possible.

However, I am considering adding a twist. I might introduce enemies that the player needs to knock down or add dummies that the player has to hit. Hitting the dummies could provide the player with bonuses, such as filling up a scale to slow down the speed, for example.
