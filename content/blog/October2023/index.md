> "Every second counts" is a phrase from The Bear that was supposed to evoke a certain feeling in me, but it didn't. I'm already well aware that every second counts. I just couldn't think of anything better to include in this part. :)

### Focus of the month

October is going to be more focused on work-related knowledge because I feel it's necessary at this point. I had considered finishing the game jam for the "extra" category, but the thought of combining it with what I need to learn for work was overwhelming, and it's not something I want to tackle right now. I'm working on building routines that will help me reach an average of 3 hours of learning per day, and I think adding the game jam would slow me down.

Here's the plan: I'll continue working with Blender, but this time I'll focus more on character creation, from modeling to animation. This area gave me some trouble during the Ludumdare, so I want to improve my skills here. For my work, I need to advance in ASP.NET, deepen my understanding of domain-driven development, and learn more about its patterns.

Additionally, during LudumDare, I used Trello, and I found it helpful for staying on track. So, I plan to use it for month-to-month planning of the knowledge I need to acquire. We'll see where it takes me.
