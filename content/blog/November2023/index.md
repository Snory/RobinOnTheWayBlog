> "Every second counts" is a phrase from The Bear that was supposed to evoke a certain feeling in me, but it didn't. I'm already well aware that every second counts. I just couldn't think of anything better to include in this part. :)

### Focus of the month

Remember, Remember, the 5th of November. 

November is going to be a special month for me. I have a two-fold goal: I want to finish the Ludumdare game jam and submit it in the extra category, and I also need to make progress in my work. This means my approach to learning will be quite different this month.

Here's the plan: I'll continue working with Blender, but this time I'll focus more on character creation, from modeling to animation. This area gave me some trouble during the Ludumdare, so I want to improve my skills here. For my work, I need to advance in ASP.NET, deepen my understanding of domain-driven development, and learn more about its patterns.

Lastly, there's the matter of finishing that game jam project. The deadline is on the 19th of November, and I have around 9 days thanks to a real-life commitments. Considering I can dedicate about an hour a day to it, that gives me roughly 9 hours to complete the game. It's a tight schedule, and I didn't calculate it before making the promise to finish it, but once I've committed, I'm determined to see it through.
