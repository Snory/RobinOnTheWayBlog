### Focus of the month

This is a list of skills I was thinking of for this month:

* Math
* Drawing
* Post-processing
* VFX graph
* Blender
* ASP.Net
* C#

But as you saw in last report, I am not able to manage that many skills in one month therefore I decided I will have to choose just three. 

First of all, it's necessary to say that ASP.Net is here solely for work, as it should be the technology in which I'm going to work next. I wasn't convinced I should spend my free time working on something I need for work but not for personal gain. However, I think that until I open my first game studio, I have to learn skills that also bring in money. With that being said, I'm going to refresh my memory on the ASP.Net theme, and after that, I'll move on to C#.

For my personal gain I think I am going to continue with GetGood for Blender and will look over the courses from Ben for regarding the post processing. 

I hope that this month I will be able to get at close close to the 3 hour average per calendar day.
